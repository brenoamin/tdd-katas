# FizzBuzz

Write a function that receives a size (integer) and returns an array with numbers from 1 to the given size. However, every number divisible by 3 will be replaced by "Fizz", divisible by 5 by "Buzz", and divisible by both by "FizzBuzz".

Example:

```js
fizzBuzz(16)
// [1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz', 16]
```
